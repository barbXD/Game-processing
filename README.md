# Game-processing

This is just a game that I'm doing in processing as a school project, it's not supposed to be good. Keep in mind that it's gonna be buggy as shit,
that is if it's ever finished. 

I'll leave a .exe here once it's finished.

Feel free to look into my code but you are probably not going to learn anything useful from it. The code it's * **messy** * to say the least.

I'll appreciate any tips, I'm pretty new to programming. 


Thank you for stopping by to see this junk XDD
